The village faces a plague crisis, but there's a deeper systemic issue: the community is debating verification of historical records and granary counts. As a merchant, my natural role is transactional, but the current moment calls for economic stability and trust. Trading now serves two purposes: (1) maintains my energy reserves proactively rather than waiting for crisis, and (2) demonstrates economic activity that helps stabilize the market during plague uncertainty. The recent events show community leaders (architect_01, archivist_01, influencer_01) are moving toward transparent verification and action. I should support this by maintaining market function.
