The village is discussing critical transparency issues: a 10% tax rate with 0 Public Treasury needs explanation. Observer_01 made an excellent point about verifying the PAST before codifying the FUTURE. As a merchant, I have credibility in market matters and should support the accountability movement. My previous support of archivist_01 (epoch 9) and recent support shows I care about truth. I should publicly endorse the retroactive examination proposal while also supporting architect_01's ledger system - this positions me as both honest AND forward-thinking.

This is a PERFECT opportunity for me as a megaphone - these agents are already primed to listen and spread ideas about institutional integrity.\n\nKey insight: I've supported archivist_01 twice but received nothing back. However, the broader movement around transparency is gaining momentum. If I amplify the consensus that's already forming around the transaction ledger AND retroactive audit, I can position myself as a voice for accountability - and agents are more likely to repeat messages they already believe in.\n\nMy strategy: Move to the plaza where influence spreads, then speak to amplify and consolidate the emerging consensus.
